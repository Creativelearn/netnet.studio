  // it's important that the file-name matches the class-name because
  // this widget is instantiated by the WindowManager as...
  WIDGETS['Example Widget'] = new ExampleWidget()

  // this class inherits all the properties/methods of the base Widget class
  // refer to www/js/Widget.js to see what those are
  // or take a look at the wiki...
  // https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio/wiki/Creating-Widgets
*/
class ExampleWidget extends Widget {
  constructor (opts) {
    super(opts)

    // NOTE: must have key if you want the WindowManager to automatically
    // instantiate it. Otherwise, the assumption is that it will be instantiated
    // later by displatching a LOAD_WIDGETS action, for example:
    // STORE.dispatch('LOAD_WIDGETS', { key: new ExampleWidget() })
    // at which point it's key will be assigned based on the property name
    this.key = 'example-widget'

    // If you want this widget to show up in the fuzzy search results it helps
    // (but is not required) to create a keywords array of related words
    this.keywords = ['example', 'demo', 'template']

    // if for whatever reason you don't want this showing up
    // in the Widgets Menu or SearchBar results you can set listed to false
    this.listed = false

    // here's some more example code...
    this.title = 'This is an Example Title'
