<h2 class="learning-guide--link">What Is Code? <button name="tut:what-is-code">play</button></h2>

<p>
  Whether or not you've ever written code, this tutorial is a good place to start. In addition to orienting you to the studio (this website), in this lesson we'll cover what code is from both a technical perspective but also a conceptual one. Like all human languages, coding languages are multipurpose. In the same way that the English language can be used to write history, laws, love letters or poems, coding languages can be used to express more than just software. Here we'll introduce the particular creative and experimental vector view that we'll be approaching code from throughout these tutorials.

<h2 class="learning-guide--link">CSS Crash Course <button name="tut:css-crash-course">play</button></h2>

<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, was a language introduced to the Web in the mid 90s for the purpose of separating a webpage's "form" or "presentation" from it's "structure" or "content". Initially it handled things like layout, color changes and typography, but today in the era of CSS3, it has evolved to become a much more expressive language capable of creating interactive effects and animations. This lesson iw a crash course on the fundamentals of CSS as well as an introduction to how CSS artists use the language in unconventional ways.
