We'll also take a look at some WebVR/XR code written with <a href=\"https://aframe.io/\" target=\"_blank\">A-Frame</a> used to create it. \"Like the word 'cyberspace', the term 'virtual reality' (VR) is now commonly used for any space created by or accessible through computers, ranging from the 3D world of a game to the Internet as an alternate 'virtual' reality constructed by a vast networked communication space.\" â€”<i>Christiane Paul (Curator of New Media Arts at the Whitney Museum of American Art)</i>.",
