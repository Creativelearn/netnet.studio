  "description": "When the web was first introduced in 1990 there was only HTML code, which handled both structuring the content of a document as well as the style of its presentation. In the years that followed it became obvious that the <i>style</i> of a web document should be handled separately from the structure of it's content, and so there were a few different proposals for how that could be handled. One such proposal for a style coding language came from Håkon W Lie who <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html\" target=\"_blank\">debuted CHSS</a> (Cascading HTML Style Sheets, later renamed CSS) at a Web conference in Chicago in 1994. The rest is history.",
