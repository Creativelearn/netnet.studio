# Creating the Web

The Web, and it's core language HTML, was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. But HTML is really only just an "idea" until there was some browser that could actually interpret code written in that language. So a year later Tim, with the help of his collaborators Robert Cailliau and Nicola Pellow, created the first web browsers.

But Tim didn't want to be the only person dictating what the Web would become. Having seen the value of openness, collaboration and decentralization in the evolution of the Internet, he figured if the Web was to become the Net's defacto hypermedia platform, it too needed to be open and collaborative.

So he started the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">The World Wide Web Consortium</a>, or W3C for short, which is a "standards organization" that anyone can join (there are over <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List" target="_blank">400 member groups</a> in total) which discuss and define how the Web should work. They're constantly coming up with new ideas for things we should be able to do on the Web and so HTML and CSS are constantly evolving.

They release these rules and designs in technical documents known as specifications, or "specs" for short. Programmers developing browsers, like Chrome or Firefox, use these specs as guides or blueprints for how the HTML code you and I write needs to be interpreted and displayed, or "rendered", onto the screen.

They're very technical and written for programmers developing Web browsers, but I always find it interesting to see what those sort of things look like even if I don't understand it all, here's the spec for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-img-element" target="_blank">img</a> element for example.

Before releasing a spec the W3C members usually discuss their ideas over email or on GitHub, both of which are intentionally published openly online for any curious netizen to read. Here's a discussion on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5608" target="_blank">how img width and heights</a> should work, and here's another discussing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770" target="_blank">the future of CSS!</a>.
