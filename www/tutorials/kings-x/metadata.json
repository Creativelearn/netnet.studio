  "description": "Self proclaimed \"artivist\" (artist + activist), Heath Bunting was among the first wave of artists to embrace the Web as a space for artistic interventions. Here we'll take a look at one of his earliest, and most written about, pieces of \"net.art\" <i>King's Cross Phone In</i> (1994). \"In this work, the web was used to transform a commuter hub, King's Cross train station (London), into a venue for social and musical spectacles.\" â€”<i>Rachel Greene (author of Internet Art)</i>.",
